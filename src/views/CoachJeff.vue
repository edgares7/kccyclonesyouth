          Coach Jeff learned and played soccer in England and moved to St.
          Louis, Missouri in 1994. By the late 1990s he began to coach his son
          and daughter in various recreational and competitive leagues.

          Always believing that the Brazilians had the most attractive and
          wonderful style, he discovered one of the keys to their long term
          success is futsal. Jeff was introduced to the five-a-side game by an
          experienced Brazilian-American futsal specialist- Tony Ziller.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          By 2004, Jeff and Tony coached a boys team to become the Midwest
          Futsal Champions. Jeff then coached them in the US Futsal Federation
          Nationals where they finished as runners up. In 2005, the boys won the
          u16 national title.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          However, it wasn’t the victories of the boys so much as the sheer joy
          of seeing players of all abilities, boys and girls, playing futsal
          that inspired Jeff to become such an advocate for futsal.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          In 2013, Jeff moved to Kansas City and helped Aaron Weissenfluh,
          another futsal aficionado, form the first u14 girls soccer team for FC
          Kansas City - the youth affiliate of the National Women's Professional
          Soccer Team. In 2016, Jeff and Henrique Pinto coached the u15 FC
          Kansas City girls to national futsal finalists.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          In 2014, via FC Kansas City, Jeff met US national futsal team player
          Henrique Pinto. Henrique and Jose Pires started the KC Cyclones men’s
          futsal team with support from Aaron.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          Jeff has been given the opportunity to travel the world to enhance his
          coaching career. Jeff has traveled to Brazil - EC Cruzeiro - to
          observe directly how a top club operates both with soccer and futsal.
          And last year, Southampton FC allowed Jeff to attend a full week of
          youth training and close observation. Southampton is one of the top
          youth academies in the world producing such outstanding talents as
          Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Liverpool’s Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade
          Chamberlain, Manchester United’s Luke Shaw.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 max-w-4xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
          Jeff holds various US coaching licenses and certificates and is a
          proud member of United Soccer Coaches.
